# Sniffy Bug: A fully autonomous swarm of gas-seeking nano quadcopters in cluttered environments

This repository contains the following:
- sniffybug-firmware: the firmware used to run experiments onboard the BitCraze CrazyFlie 2.1.
- sniffybug-swarmulator: a fork of swarmulator, a lightweight c++ robot simulator. This version of swarmulator allows for testing gas source localization algorithms in a variety of environments.
- AutoGDM: coming soon!
- CrazyFlie gas deck PCB files: coming soon!
